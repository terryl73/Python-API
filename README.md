# Python-API


This project collects API weather data across the world from a live website, stores the data in Pandas dataframes and then graphs the data in different scatterplots to show relationships between those data points and latitude.  

The final presentation of this file is stored in the Final Work folder.  Below is a list of each of the files used there:

Cloud_Scatter - Shows a picture of a scatter chart showing cloud cover vs latitude.

Humidity_Scatter - Shows a picture of a scatter chart showing humidity vs latitude.

Temp_Scatter - Shows a picture of a scatter chart showing temperature vs latitude. 

Weather API Thoughts - A Word document with a brief explanation of each chart and observations about the data presented in each chart.  

WeatherPy-Final - The code that pulls in API data and creates the graphs listed using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib.

Wind_Scatter - Shows a picture of a scatter chart showing wind speed vs latitude.
